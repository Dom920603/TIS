# 💡Reflection
I realised that the role of an IT professional is not only about writing code, but also about proper planning, system development, teamwork, and having strong fundamental knowledge in the IT field. Understanding project management and the SDLC helped me see how a system is developed step by step, from planning and design to testing, deployment, and maintenance. This makes the development process more transparent and allows progress and potential issues to be tracked more easily, helping projects run smoothly.

Moreover, I also learned that effective communication and collaboration are essential in the industry, as most projects are team-based and cannot be completed individually. Each team member has a specific role, and good teamwork ensures tasks are completed efficiently. In addition, it is important to build strong fundamental knowledge rather than over-relying on AI. AI should be used as an assisting tool to improve productivity, not as a replacement for understanding. Overall, this talk inspired me to reflect on the preparations I need to start making now before stepping into my future career.
