# 💡Reflection
I learned that computer science is not only about writing code, but also about proper planning, system development, and teamwork. Understanding project management and the SDLC helped me see how a project is developed step by step, from planning and design to testing, deployment, and maintenance. Having a clear structure is important to ensure that projects run smoothly and to reduce mistakes during development.

I also realised that communication and collaboration are essential, as most projects are team-based and cannot be completed individually. Each team member plays a different role, and effective teamwork helps ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. In addition, while AI can be a helpful tool to support learning and productivity, building strong fundamental knowledge is still crucial. By understanding concepts clearly, I can use AI as a support rather than relying on it completely, which will better prepare me for future academic work and industry challenges.
