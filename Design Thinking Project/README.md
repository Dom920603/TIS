Design thinking has allowed me to apply creativity to solve real-world problems through a structured process of empathy, define, ideate, prototype, and test. By understanding users’ needs and transforming ideas into practical solutions, I was able to develop MEGA, a system that helps users track household electricity usage and encourages energy saving to protect the environment. This experience strengthened my confidence in designing technology-based systems. Through this learning process, I also realised the importance of effective communication, as it helps in understanding user problems and ensures smooth collaboration within a team. In addition, I recognised the need to improve my ability to use AI to increase efficiency, especially for repetitive tasks, while still maintaining strong fundamental knowledge and avoiding over-reliance on AI.
